## Usage

This is a simple GitHub Action to deploy current repo to a Deta Micro. Uses `deta deploy` command to deploy the latest changes as per [documentation](https://docs.deta.sh/docs/cli/commands/#deta-deploy). 

## Inputs

### `deta-access-token`

**Required**. The access token generated by Deta. Used for `deta clone` and `deta deploy` commands.

You can generate your own access token from your [Deta account](https://web.deta.sh/home/) in order to avoid web login. Follow the Authetication documentation [here](https://docs.deta.sh/docs/cli/auth).

‚ö†Ô∏è Be **very** sure you don't share the token or paste it in plain text! You can add it to the GitHub project's secrets as it follows:

- On your project's page click on the **Settings** button;
- Navigate to **Secrets** panel;
- Click on **New secret**;
- Name it `DETA_TOKEN` and paste the key there.

Now you can use the key in your project's actions as `${{ secrets.DETA_TOKEN }}`. Read more about [GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets).
